# SQL


SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language for interacting with data stored in relational database.\
Relational database is a collection of tables. Each row (record) of a table contains a single entity. Each column (field) of a table contains a single attribute.\
Aliasing means you assign a temporary name to something.

Sidenotes:
1. COMMANDS are not case-sensitive.
2. Add semicolon at the end of query.
3. NULL represents a missing or unknown value.
