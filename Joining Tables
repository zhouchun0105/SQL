# UNION functions as union the non-duplicate items from two tables
SELECT * FROM economies2010
UNION
SELECT * FROM economies2015
ORDER BY code, year;

# UNION ALL includes duplicates
SELECT code, year
FROM economies
UNION ALL
SELECT country_code, year
FROM populations
ORDER BY code, year;

# INTERSECT select dataset with common value for each selected column in two tables
# code and year are both in common for two tables
SELECT code, year FROM economies
INTERSECT
SELECT country_code, year FROM populations
ORDER BY code, year;

# EXCEPT select ones in the first table but not in the second table
SELECT name FROM cities
EXCEPT
SELECT capital FROM countries
ORDER BY name;

# Subquery
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM languages
WHERE code IN
(SELECT code FROM countries
WHERE region = 'Middle East')
ORDER BY name;

# INNER JOIN (not familiar with)
SELECT c1.code, name, basic_unit AS currency
FROM countries AS c1
INNER JOIN currencies AS c2
ON c1.code = c2.code
WHERE c1.continent = 'Oceania';

# Semi-join select records from first table where conditions met in the second table
# Anti-join select records from first table where conditions not met in the second table
